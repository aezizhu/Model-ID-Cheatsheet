# Railway configuration for the auto-update cron service.
#
# Setup: In your Railway project, create a second service pointing to this repo.
# Then set its config file path to "configs/railway-updater.toml" in the service
# settings, or copy this file to railway.toml in the service's root directory.
#
# No provider API keys needed — the updater scrapes public documentation pages.
#
# Required environment variables (set in Railway dashboard):
#   GITHUB_TOKEN  - GitHub personal access token with repo scope
#   GITHUB_REPO   - Repository in "owner/repo" format (e.g. "aezizhu/universal-model-registry")
